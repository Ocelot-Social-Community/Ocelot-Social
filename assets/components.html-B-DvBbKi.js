When you find yourself using <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> the code you are talking about should probably be split up into two or more components.</p><p>On the other hand, when something is easily expressed in a few lines of HTML and SCSS and not likely to be reused this is a good indicator that it should <em>not</em> go into a separate component.</p><h2 id="we-compose-with-components" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#we-compose-with-components"><span>We compose with components</span></a></h2><p>Usually <code>pages</code> use <code>layouts</code> as templates and will be composed of <code>features</code>. <code>features</code> are composed of <code>components</code>, the smallest building blocks of the app. The further down we go in this hierarchy the simpler and more generic the components become. Here is an example:</p><ul><li>The <code>index</code> page is responsible for displaying a list of posts. It uses the <code>default</code> layout and the <code>PostList</code> feature.</li><li>The <code>PostList</code> feature uses a <code>List</code> component to render <code>PostTeaser</code> features.</li><li>The <code>PostTeaser</code> feature consists of a <code>LayoutCard</code> wrapped around a <code>CardImage</code>, <code>CardTitle</code> and <code>CardContent</code> component.</li></ul><p>The <code>index</code> page is unique in the app and will never be reused. The <code>PostList</code> knows it is handling post data and can therefore not be used for anything else – but it can display posts on the <code>index</code> as well as the <code>user</code> page.</p><p>The <code>Card</code> on the other hand does not care about the type of data it needs to handle. It just takes whatever it receives and renders it in a certain way, so it can be reused throughout the app for many different features.</p><h2 id="we-use-two-word-names" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#we-use-two-word-names"><span>We use two-word names</span></a></h2><p>We follow the W3C rules for naming custom elements as suggested in the <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-registration.html#Component-Names" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vue.js docs</a> to differentiate our own components from regular HTML elements in our templates.</p><p>Names should also be meaningful and unique to avoid confusion and code duplication, and also not too long to make them readable.
