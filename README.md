[Ocelot.social](https://ocelot.social) is free and open source software program code to run social networks. Its development is supported by a community of programmers and interested network operators.

Our goal is to enable people to participate fairly and equally in online social networks. The equality of opportunity applies both to the fundamental equality of all people and to the possibility of letting their diverse voices be heard.

We therefore consider it desirable that operators offer such networks so that people can choose where they want to be on the move.

Our vision for the future is that at some point it should be possible to link these networks together (ActivityPub, Fediverse) so that users can also connect with people from other networks - for example, by friending them or following posts or other contributions.

If you would like to help set up this capability with us, please contact us.

In other words, we are interested in a network of networks and in keeping the data as close as possible to the user and the operator they trusts.

## For Developers and Contributors

### Introduction

Have a look into our short video:
[ocelot.social - GitHub - Developer Welcome - Tutorial (english)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZSL6KvBIiY&list=PLFMD5liPP01kbuReHxYXxv_1fI5rIgS1f&index=1)

### Directory Layout

There are three important directories:

- [Backend](./backend) runs on the server and is a middleware between database and frontend
- [Frontend](./webapp) is a server-side-rendered and client-side-rendered web frontend
- [Cypress](./cypress) contains end-to-end tests and executable feature specifications

In order to setup the application and start to develop features you have to
setup **webapp** and **backend**.

There are two approaches:

1. [Local](#local-installation) installation, which means you have to take care of dependencies yourself.
2. **Or** install everything through [Docker](#docker-installation) which takes care of dependencies for you.

### Installation

#### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository, this will create a new folder called `Ocelot-Social`:

Using HTTPS:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Ocelot-Social-Community/Ocelot-Social.git
```

Using SSH:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:Ocelot-Social-Community/Ocelot-Social.git
```

Change into the new folder.

```bash
$ cd Ocelot-Social
```

### Live Demo and Developer Logins

**Try out our deployed [development environment](https://stage.ocelot.social).**

Visit our staging networks:

- central staging network: [stage.ocelot.social](https://stage.ocelot.social)
<!-- - rebranded staging network: [rebrand.ocelot.social](https://stage.ocelot.social). -->

#### Login

Logins for the live demos and developers (local developers after the following installations) in the browser:

| email | password | role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `user@example.org` | 1234 | user |
| `moderator@example.org` | 1234 | moderator |
| `admin@example.org` | 1234 | admin |

#### Docker Installation

Docker is a software development container tool that combines software and its dependencies into one standardized unit that contains everything needed to run it. This helps us to avoid problems with dependencies and makes installation easier.

##### General Installation of Docker

There are [several ways to install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your computer or server.

Check the correct Docker installation by checking the version before proceeding. E.g. we have the following versions:

```bash
# use Docker version 24.0.6 or newer
# includes Docker Compose
$ docker --version
```

##### Start Ocelot-Social via Docker Compose

***ATTENTION:** For using Docker commands in Apple Silicon environments see [here](https://github.com/Ocelot-Social-Community/Ocelot-Social/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#apple-silicon-platform).*

Prepare ENVs once beforehand:

```bash
# in folder webapp/
$ cp .env.template .env

# in folder backend/
$ cp .env.template .env
```

For Development:

```bash
# in main folder
$ docker compose up
```

For Production:

```bash
# in main folder
$ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

This will start all required Docker containers.  
Make sure your database is running on `http://localhost:7474/browser/`.

Prepare database once before you start by running the following command in a second terminal:

```bash
# in main folder while docker compose is up
$ docker compose exec backend yarn run db:migrate init
$ docker compose exec backend yarn run db:migrate up
```

Then clear and seed database by running the following command as well in the second terminal:

```bash
# in main folder while docker compose is up
$ docker compose exec backend yarn run db:reset
$ docker compose exec backend yarn run db:seed
```

For a closer description see [backend](./backend/README.md).  
For a full documentation of the Docker installation see [summary](./SUMMARY.md).

#### Local Installation

### Deployment

Deployment methods can be found in our `deployment` folder described in the [README](./deployment/README.md).
Our branding template is our [stage.ocelot.social](https://github.com/Ocelot-Social-Community/stage.ocelot.social) repository.
Place your branding repository inside `deployment/configurations`.

The only deployment method in this repository for production purposes is [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) for now.
But we just started to develop a deployment for [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) as well.

The only deployment method with branding in this repository for development purposes as described above is [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

```bash
# in folder deployment/
# set your branding folder name in .env
# then run
$ docker compose up
```

The code is branded automatically.
To setup the Neo4j database see above.
