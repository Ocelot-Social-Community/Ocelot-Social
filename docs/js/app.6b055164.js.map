features. If you really need to, it might be better to create a new one and mark the existing component as `deprecated`\\n\\n### Creating new components\\n\\nKeep a few things in mind when creating a new component:\\n* Keep it simple\\n* Keep it extendable\\n* Use Design Tokens wherever needed\\n* Document it\\n\\n### Resources \\n\\nIf you would like to become a component superhero feel free to dive
