# Webapp

## Installation

For preparation we need Node and recommend to use [node version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) `nvm` to switch
between different local Node versions:

```bash
# install Node
$ cd webapp
$ nvm install v20.12.1
$ nvm use v20.12.1
```

Install node dependencies with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/):

```bash
# install all dependencies
$ cd webapp
$ yarn install
# or just
$ yarn
# or just later on to use version of ".nvmrc" file
$ nvm use && yarn
```

Copy:

```text
# in webapp
cp .env.template .env
```

Configure the files according to your needs and your local setup.

### Build for Development

```bash
# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev
```

### Build for Production

```bash
# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start
```

### Run tests

We ensure the quality of our frontend code by using
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for checking our JavaScript code
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Vue Test Utils](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/) to unit test our components
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to document and manually test our components in an isolated playground

For more information see our [frontend testing guide](testing.md). Use these commands to run the tests:

::: tabs
@tab:active With Docker

After starting the application following the above guidelines, open new terminal windows for each of these commands:

```bash
# run eslint
$ docker-compose exec webapp yarn lint
```

```bash
# run unit tests
$ docker-compose exec webapp yarn test
```

```bash
# start storybook
$ docker-compose exec webapp yarn storybook
```

You can then visit the Storybook playground on `http://localhost:3002`

@tab title Without Docker

After starting the application following the above guidelines, open new terminal windows and navigate to the `/webapp` directory for each of these commands:

```bash
# run eslint in /webapp (use option --fix to normalize the files)
$ yarn lint
```

```bash
# run unit tests in /webapp
$ yarn test
```

```bash
# run locales in /webapp (use option --fix to sort the locales)
$ yarn locales
```

```bash
# start storybook in /webapp
$ yarn storybook
```

You can then visit the Storybook playground on `http://localhost:3002`

## Maintenance Mode

For installing and running the maintenance mode see [Maintenance Mode](./maintenance/README.md).

## Styleguide Migration

We are currently in the process of migrating our styleguide components and design tokens from the [Nitro Styleguide](https://github.com/Ocelot-Social-Community/HC-Styleguide-20201003) into the main [ocelot.social repository](https://github.com/Ocelot-Social-Community/Ocelot-Social) and refactoring our components in the process. During this migration, our new components will live in a `_new/` folder to separate them from the old, yet untouched components.

### Folder Structure

The folder structure we are following is [prescribed by Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/directory-structure):

- **assets** contains icons, images and logos in `svg` format and all shared SCSS files such as `tokens`
- **components** separated into two sub-folders:
    - **generic** are the generic building blocks of the app â€“ small, reusable and usually not coupled to state
    - **features** are composed of components but tied to a particular function of the app (e.g. `comment` or `post`)
- **layouts** can use components to create layout templates for pages
- **pages** are the entry points for all `routes` in the app and are composed of layouts, features and components
