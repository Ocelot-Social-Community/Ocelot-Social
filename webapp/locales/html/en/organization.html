  <h2>
    <b>Reformer.network</b> – A Safe Space for Real Change
  </h2>
  <p>
    <b>Reformer.network</b> is a closed space for people who want more than just discussion.
    We are a vibrant network for open exchange, collective action, and systemic change – beyond party politics,
    platform logic, and spirals of fear.
    Our goal:
    To strengthen an enlightened, dignified, and empowered civil society.
  </p>
  <p>
    We see ourselves as a <b>community of the courageous</b>:
    People who want to think with clarity, speak with heart, and act together with others.
    For this, we create structures, safe spaces, and tools.
    At the center is the human being – with a real name, real identity, and real responsibility.
  </p>
  <h2>
    What Unites Us

      <b>Community and Integrity</b><br />
      We respect each other – regardless of background, profession, or worldview.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Impact over Noise</b><br />
      Our platform is not a stage for self-promotion, but a workspace for ideas, projects, and real progress.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>
    Who We Are
  </h2>
  <p>
    <b>Reformer.network</b> is operated technically and organizationally by Redcap B.V. on behalf of Stichting Rudulin in
    Amsterdam. Behind it is a growing team of developers, moderators, visionaries, journalists,
    and activists from across the German-speaking world.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Why We Exist
  </h2>
  <p>
    Because many people feel: A new place is needed.
    Without censorship and division.
    With courage for truth and space for new solutions.
    <b>Reformer.network</b> is our contribution to that – decentralized, collective, and humane.
