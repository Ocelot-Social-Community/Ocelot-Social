# Velero

{% hint style="danger" %}
I tried Velero and it did not work reliably all the time. Sometimes the
kubernetes cluster crashes during recovery or data is not fully recovered.

Feel free to test it out and update this documentation once you feel that it's
working reliably. It is very likely that DigitalOcean had some bugs when I
tried out the steps below.
{% endhint %}

We use [velero](https://github.com/heptio/velero) for on premise backups, we
tested on version `v0.11.0`, you can find their
documentation [here](https://heptio.github.io/velero/v0.11.0/).

Our kubernets configurations adds some annotations to pods. The annotations
define the important persistent volumes that need to be backed up. Velero will
pick them up and store the volumes in the same cluster but in another namespace
`velero`.

## Prequisites

You have to install the binary `velero` on your computer and get a tarball of
the latest release. We use `v0.11.0` so visit the
[release](https://github.com/heptio/velero/releases/tag/v0.11.0) page and
download and extract e.g. [velero-v0.11.0-linux-arm64.tar.gz](https://github.com/heptio/velero/releases/download/v0.11.0/velero-v0.11.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz).


## Setup Velero Namespace

Follow their [getting started](https://heptio.github.io/velero/v0.11.0/get-started)
instructions to setup the Velero namespace. We use
[Minio](https://docs.min.io/docs/deploy-minio-on-kubernetes) and
[restic](https://github.com/restic/restic), so check out Velero's instructions
how to setup [restic](https://heptio.github.io/velero/v0.11.0/restic):

```sh
# run from the extracted folder of the tarball
$ kubectl apply -f config/common/00-prereqs.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f config/minio/
```

Once completed, you should see the namespace in your kubernetes dashboard.

## Manually Create an On-Premise Backup

When you create your deployments for Human Connection the required annotations
should already be in place. So when you create a backup of namespace
`human-connection`:

```sh
$ velero backup create hc-backup --include-namespaces=human-connection
```

That should backup your persistent volumes, too. When you enter:

```sh
$ velero backup describe hc-backup --details
```

You should see the persistent volumes at the end of the log:

```sh
....

Restic Backups:
  Completed:
    human-connection/develop-backend-5b6dd96d6b-q77n6: uploads
    human-connection/develop-neo4j-686d768598-z2vhh: neo4j-data
```

## Simulate a Disaster

Feel free to try out if you loose any data when you simulate a disaster and try
to restore the namespace from the backup:

```sh
$ kubectl delete namespace human-connection
```

Wait until the wrongdoing has completed, then:
```sh
$ velero restore create --from-backup hc-backup
```

Now, I keep my fingers crossed that everything comes back again. If not, I feel
very sorry for you.


## Schedule a Regular Backup

Check out the [docs](https://heptio.github.io/velero/v0.11.0/get-started). You
can create a regular schedule e.g. with:

```sh
$ velero schedule create hc-weekly-backup --schedule="@weekly" --include-namespaces=human-connection
```

Inspect the created backups:

```sh
$ velero schedule get
NAME               STATUS    CREATED                          SCHEDULE   BACKUP TTL   LAST BACKUP   SELECTOR
hc-weekly-backup   Enabled   2019-05-08 17:51:31 +0200 CEST   @weekly    720h0m0s     6s ago        <none> 

$ velero backup get
NAME                              STATUS      CREATED                          EXPIRES   STORAGE LOCATION   SELECTOR
hc-weekly-backup-20190508155132   Completed   2019-05-08 17:51:32 +0200 CEST   29d       default            <none>

$ velero backup describe hc-weekly-backup-20190508155132 --details
# see if the persistent volumes are backed up
```
