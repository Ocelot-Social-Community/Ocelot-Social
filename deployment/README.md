## Usage

Fork this repository to configure and rebrand it for your own [ocelot.social](https://github.com/Ocelot-Social-Community/Ocelot-Social) network.

### Package.Json And DockerHub Organisation

Write your own data into the main configuration file:

- [package.json](/package.json)

Since all deployment methods described here depend on [Docker](https://docker.com) and [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com), you need to create your own organisation on DockerHub and put its name in the [package.json](/package.json) file as your `dockerOrganisation`.

### Configure And Branding

The next step is:

- [Configure And Branding](/branding/README.md)

### Optional: Locally Testing Configuration And Branding

Just in case you have Docker installed and run the following, you can check your branding locally:

```bash
# in main folder
$ docker-compose up
# fill the database with an initial admin
$ docker-compose exec backend yarn run prod:migrate init
```

The database is then initialised with the default administrator:

- E-mail: admin@example.org
- Password: 1234

For login or registration have a look in your browser at `http://localhost:3000/`.  
For the maintenance page have a look in your browser at `http://localhost:5000/`.

### Push Changes To GitHub

Before merging these changes into the "master" branch on your GitHub fork repository, you need to configure the GitHub repository secrets.  This is necessary to [publish](/.github/workflows/publish.yml) the Docker images by pushing them via GitHub actions to repositories belonging to your DockerHub organisation.

First, go to your DockerHub profile under `Account Settings` and click on the `Security` tab. There you create an access token called `<your-organisation>-access-token` and copy the token to a safe place.

Secondly, in your GitHub repository, click on the 'Settings' tab and go to the 'Secrets' tab.  There you create two secrets by clicking on `New repository secret`:

1. Named `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` with the newly created DockerHub token (only the code, not the token name).
2. Named `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` with your DockerHub username.

### Optional: Locally Testing Your DockerHub Images

Just in case you like to check your pushed Docker images in your organisation's DockerHub repositories locally:

- rename the file `docker-compose.ocelotsocial-branded.yml` with your network name
- in the file, rename the ocelot.social DockerHub organisation `ocelotsocialnetwork` to your organisations name

Remove any local Docker images if necessary and do the following:

```bash
# in main folder
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.<your-organisation>-branded.yml up
# fill the database with an initial admin
$ docker-compose exec backend yarn run prod:migrate init
```

See the login details and browser addresses above.

### Deployment

Afterwards you can [deploy](/deployment/README.md) it on your server:

- [Kubernetes with Helm](/deployment/kubernetes/README.md)
