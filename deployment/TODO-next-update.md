### Deployment/Rebranding PR ‚Äì chore: [WIP] üç∞ Refine docs, first step #46

Upgrade the cert-manager, but install CRDs of the version 1.0.0-alpha to actually be able to upgrade ocelot. Then uninstall the legacy CRDs and install the correct ones.

```bash
# upgrade cert-manager to 1.9.1
> helm upgrade --set installCRDs=true --version 1.9.1 --namespace cert-manager cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager
# apply legacy CRDs
> kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.0.0-alpha.1/cert-manager.crds.yaml
# upgrade ocelot
> helm upgrade ocelot ./
# delete legacy CRDs
> kubectl delete -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.0.0-alpha.1/cert-manager.crds.yaml
# apply CRDs for cert-manager 1.9.1
> kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.9.1/cert-manager.crds.yaml
```

Background: We had to upgrade cert-manager due to an external dependency - therefore we had to update cert-manager apiVersion `cert-manager.io/v1alpha2` to `cert-manager.io/v1`.

The error occurring when not doing this is the following:

```bash
Error: UPGRADE FAILED: unable to build kubernetes objects from current release manifest: [resource mapping not found for name: "letsencrypt-production" namespace: "" from "": no matches for kind "ClusterIssuer" in version "cert-manager.io/v1alpha2"
ensure CRDs are installed first, resource mapping not found for name: "letsencrypt-staging" namespace: "" from "": no matches for kind "ClusterIssuer" in version "cert-manager.io/v1alpha2"
ensure CRDs are installed first]
```

## Version >= 1.0.8 with 'ocelotDockerVersionTag' 1.0.8-182

- You have to add the `COOKIE_EXPIRE_TIME` from the `deployment/kubernetes/values.template.yaml` to your `deployment/kubernetes/values.yaml` and set it to your preferred value.
- Correct `locale` cookie exploration time in data privacy.
