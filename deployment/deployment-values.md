# Deployment Values

For each deployment, you need to set the environment variables and configurations.
Here is some specific information on how to set the values.

## Webapp

We have several configuration possibilities just in the frontend.

### Date Time

In file `branding/constants/dateTime.js`.

- `RELATIVE_DATETIME`
  - `true` (default) or `false`
- `ABSOLUT_DATETIME_FORMAT`
  - definition see [date-fns, format](https://date-fns.org/v3.3.1/docs/format):
    - `P`: just localized date
    - `Pp`: just localized date and time

## E-Mails

You need to set environment variables to send registration and invitation information or notifications to users, for example.

### SPF and DKIM

More and more e-mail providers require settings for authorization and verification of e-mail senders.

### SPF

Sometimes it is enough to create an SPF record in your DNS.

### DKIM

However, if you need DKIM authorization and verification, you must set the appropriate environment variables in: `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` or Helm script `values.yaml`:

```bash
SMTP_DKIM_DOMAINNAME=<your e-mail sender domain>
SMTP_DKIM_KEYSELECTOR=2017
SMTP_DKIM_PRIVATKEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n<your base64 encoded privat key data>\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

You can find out how DKIM works here:

To create the private and public DKIM key, see here:

Information about the required PEM format can be found here:

## Neo4j Database

We have several configuration options for our Neo4j database.

### DBMS_DEFAULT_DATABASE â€“ Default Database Name to be Used

If you need to set the default database name in Neo4j to be used for all operations and terminal commands like our backup scripts, you must set the appropriate environment variable in: `.env`, `docker-compose.yml` or Helm script `values.yaml`:

```yaml
DBMS_DEFAULT_DATABASE: "graph.db"
```

The default value is `neo4j` if it is not set.

As example see files:

- `neo4j/.env.template`
- `deployment/docker-compose.yml`
- `deployment/configurations/stage.ocelot.social/kubernetes/values.yaml.template`
