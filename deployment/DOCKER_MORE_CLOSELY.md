$ export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64
```

### Docker Compose Override File For Apple M1 Platform

For Docker compose `up` or `build` commands, you can use our Apple M1 override file that specifies the M1 platform:

```bash
# in main folder

# for production
$ docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.apple-m1.override.yml up

# for production testing Docker images from DockerHub
$ docker compose -f docker-compose.ocelotsocial-branded.yml -f docker-compose.apple-m1.override.yml up

# only once: init admin user and create indexes and constraints in Neo4j database
$ docker compose exec backend /bin/sh -c "yarn prod:migrate init"
```
