Feature: Report and Moderate
  As a user
  I would like to report content that violates the community guidlines
  So the moderators can take action on it

  As a moderator
  I would like to see all reported content
  So I can look into it and decide what to do

  Background:
    Given the following "users" are in the database:
      | slug      | email                 | password | id            | name                                          | role      | termsAndConditionsAgreedVersion |

    And the following "posts" are in the database:
      | authorId      | id | title                         | content                                              |
      | annoying-user | p1 | The Truth about the Holocaust | It never existed!                                    |
      | annoying-user | p2 | Fake news                     | This content is demonstratably infactual in some way |

    When I am logged in as "user"
    And I navigate to page "<Page>" 
    And I click on "Report Post" from the content menu of the post
    And I confirm the reporting dialog because it is a criminal act under German law:
      """
      Do you really want to report the contribution "The Truth about the Holocaust"?
      """
    Then I see a toaster with "Thanks for reporting!"

    And I confirm the reporting dialog because he is a holocaust denier:
      """
      Do you really want to report the user "I'm gonna mute Moderators and â€¦"?
      """
    Then I see a toaster with "Thanks for reporting!"
